# Project 1#

Pick a topic in which a collector can build up a number of items (ie Movies, Books, Albums)

- Create a number of questions about your topic that can be asked to a user and store the answers in variables.

- One of the questions should require a numerical answer and a calculation should be done on this result.

- Store this information in a list.
- Store this list in another list called inventory.
- have a way of printing out one of the items (including the result of the calculation)
- write a menu that allows for users to enter an item, print all items or exit the program
